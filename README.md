This is a simple prototype of an app that combines the best parts of
[jsbin][] and [hackbook][] into a seamless experience that makes it
easy for novices to tinker with writing their own webpages.

The app is intended to be entirely static HTML/CSS/JS files,
leveraging the existing [hackpub][] service for publishing.

  [jsbin]: http://jsbin.com/
  [hackbook]: http://hackbook.hackasaurus.org/
  [hackpub]: https://github.com/hackasaurus/hackpub
